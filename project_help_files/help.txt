Pre) Ensure you have git installed on your box



1) Get the repository from github

-- git clone https://github.com/Kerptastic/csbt.git





2) Create a branch to work out of

-- git checkout -b <branch name>

          or do it in 2 lines

-- git branch <branch name>
-- git checkout <branch name>





3) Make your changes in your branch. Once done, add the files to the staging area for commit.
Do this at the project directory to recursively add all files.

-- git add .

          or add individually

-- git add <filename1>
-- git add <filename2>





4) Now commit to your LOCAL branch (nothing done on github)

-- git commit -m '<some message about your changes>'





5) Now push it to github. THIS WILL NOT MERGE IT INTO MASTEER!!! You will see the changes in
your branch on github, but not in your local master or the master...

-- git push origin <branch name>





5) Everything looks good? OK - time to push it to master. First, switch to your local master
branch. Then merge the info from the working branch to the master. Finally, push it to the
origin master branch.

-- git checkout master
-- git merge <branch name>
-- git push origin master
